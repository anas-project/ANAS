`module.yml` is authoritative for the parameter inventory. The CLI combines defaults, types, required flags, environment mapping, sensitivity, and change executors. Technical docs must not invent additional settable parameters.

## Identity and authorization data flow

Samba AD supplies users and groups. The Portal authenticates against the directory, and IAM publishes OIDC/SAML endpoints and group attributes to consumers. `Admins` may enter the Manager.

| Capability | Current declaration |
| --- | --- |
| Directory / LDAPS | ldaps authentication/search (`users, groups`) |
| IAM | provider: oidc, saml |
| Group | `Admins` + Consumer `APP_*` |
| Directory password writeback | restricted password-bind identity |

There is currently no generic `anas user/group/password` command. Directory-backed modules synchronize through their own mechanisms. Manage users, groups, and directory passwords in Samba AD/LAM or an application with restricted LDAPS password writeback; neither `anas config set` nor `env.<KEY>` is a directory operation.

## Management surfaces and secret lifecycle

There is no independent local `break_glass` account. Manager and Portal share directory authentication; recover IAM or the directory from the host instead of relying on a nonexistent local password.

This module declares no account managed by `anas admin local`; `credential` and `rotate` are unavailable for it.

### Secret boundaries

- `LLNG_OIDC_SERVICE_KEY_ID`
- `LLNG_SERVICE_PRIVATE_KEY`
- `LLNG_SERVICE_PUBLIC_KEY`
- `SAMBA_DC_PASSWORD_BIND_DN`
- `SAMBA_DC_PASSWORD_BIND_PASSWORD`

Generated values and lifecycle-managed credentials use stable logical keys in workspace `.anas/secrets.yml` (`0600`). It is permission-protected plaintext, not an encrypted vault. Plaintext must not enter README files, locks, logs, or ordinary `config list`. Local-administrator names and secret references live in password-free `.anas/local-admins.yml`; hooks receive plaintext only for the required lifecycle phase. `bcrypt` accounts persist only a hash in runtime configuration, while `plaintext_on_bootstrap` accounts use a `0600` projection at `.anas/runtime-secrets/local-admins/<module>/<id>.password`. Snapshots/backups must keep the secret store, account inventory, and application data at one recovery point.

### Signing-key exposure and rotation

Treat an OIDC/SAML signing private key as potentially exposed whenever it enters
terminal output, logs, test reports, task transcripts, or any other non-secret
boundary, even without evidence of external transmission. Diagnostics must read
an exact allowlist of configuration keys rather than recursively dumping LLNG
configuration. Reports may contain a key ID, fingerprint, and public key, never
the private-key body.

ANAS does not automatically rotate a running LLNG key. Rotation is a separately
approved operation: inventory whether every RP/SP consumes dynamic JWKS/metadata
or pins a certificate, back up workspace secrets and LLNG configuration, create
the replacement and publish its public material, refresh pinned trust, verify
OIDC/SAML login and logout, and retire the old key only after token/assertion
lifetime and rollback windows close. A deployment without overlapping-key
support needs a maintenance window. Until rotation is approved, record the
incident, restrict access to the affected transcript/log, and retain an explicit
rotation action; never silently overwrite the secret.

## Database support

| Item | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Role | Consumer |
| Interfaces | `postgres`, `mariadb` |
| Default | `postgres` |
| Resource | `primary_database` |
| Credential policy | `generated` |
| Deletion policy | `retain` |

The runner creates a dedicated database, principal, and stable generated credential. Changing `db_type` or `db_name` never migrates existing data.

## Environment ownership

### Exports

- `ANAS_IAM_BINDING_*`
- `ANAS_IAM_PORTAL_URL`

### Explicit consumes

- `ANAS_TLS_CERTS_DIR`
- `ANAS_TLS_INTERNAL_CA_NAME`
- `SAMBA_DC_ADMIN_GROUP_NAME`
- `SAMBA_DC_BASE_GROUPS_DN`
- `SAMBA_DC_BASE_GROUPS_ROLE_DN`
- `SAMBA_DC_BASE_USERS_DN`
- `SAMBA_DC_LDAPS_PORT`
- `SAMBA_DC_LDAPS_SERVER_URL`
- `SAMBA_DC_PASSWORD_BIND_DN`
- `SAMBA_DC_USER_CLASS_FILTER`
- `SAMBA_DC_USER_EMAIL`
- `SAMBA_DC_USER_ENABLED_FILTER`
- `SAMBA_DC_USER_NAME`
- `TRAEFIK_DOMAIN_FULL`
- `TRAEFIK_HOSTNAME`
- `ANAS_IDENTITY_OIDC_CLIENTS`
- `ANAS_IDENTITY_SAML_CLIENTS`
- `ANAS_IAM_CLIENT_*`
- `APPS_LIST*`
- `SAMBA_DC_PASSWORD_BIND_PASSWORD`

The dependency closure does not grant every environment value. Sensitive values enter this module's hook/container scope only through ownership or an explicit `config.consumes` claim.

## Hooks, changes, and rollback

- Hook command: `go run ./hook`
- `credential_rotate`, `data_migrate`, and `immutable` are blocked from ordinary edits; the declared lifecycle operation must update persistent application state.
- A local-administrator rotation commits the generated secret only after the module handler succeeds; failure keeps or restores the old application credential.

## Tests and implementation locations

- [`iam_test.go`](../hook/iam_test.go)
- [`module.yml`](../module.yml)
- [`docker-compose.yml`](../docker-compose.yml)

## Current limitations

Do not configure the removed `LLNG_PASSWORD`; it does not create an upstream administrator.
